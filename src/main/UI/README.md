# UI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.1.

## Before Running Dev Server: Ensure the backend apiUrl
Before running the dev server, ensure that the apiUrl value in the environment.prod.ts file contains the backend application endpoint. The Java Spring Boot application runs on http://localhost:8080 and should already contain this value. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
